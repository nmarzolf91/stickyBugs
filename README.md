# stickyBugs: Comparing insect emergence from forested and urban streams, Durham, NC

This repository will contain data, code, and figures from the stickyBugs project. We are collecting, identifying, and counting insects from sticky traps deployed in two streams in Durham, NC: New Hope Creek (NHC) and Ellerbee Creek (EC). The watershed for NHC is dominated by Duke Forest, and a largely forested land-use throughout the watershed. In contrast, the two sites on EC (GS and NG) reflect the development and urban land-cover throughout the EC watershed.

Emergent aquatic insects can help us determine the effect of land-use on stream ecosystems. We are interested in the diversity, abundance, and phenology of emergent insects between the two streams. We will pair the findings in this project with on-going measurements of basal metabolism, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions to identify differences in streams with differing land uses.
